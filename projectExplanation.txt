Here's a concise project explanation you can use in documentation or presentations:

ðŸ“˜ Project Explanation â€“ Distributor Service Backend (Django)

Overview:
This project is a backend REST API service built using Django and Django REST Framework. It is designed to handle distributor onboarding and payment confirmation workflows in a scalable, modular way. It also provides hooks for future integration with enterprise systems like SAP and payment gateways like Cashfree.

Modules & Features:

1. Distributor Management

   * Stores distributor profiles including name, GST number, PAN, and bank details.
   * Allows onboarding of new distributors and updating existing profiles via REST APIs.

2. Payment Records

   * Records payments associated with distributors including transaction ID, amount, status, and metadata.
   * Includes a simulation of payment confirmation (e.g., via Cashfree).

3. API Endpoints

   * /api/distributors/ (GET, POST, PUT)
   * /api/payments/ (GET, POST)
   * Built using Django REST Framework with ModelViewSets and serializers.

4. Integration Points

   * SAP: Two placeholder functions are defined (sync\_distributor\_with\_sap and sync\_payment\_with\_sap) for integrating data into external ERP systems.
   * Cashfree: A function named confirm\_payment\_with\_cashfree simulates external payment confirmation. This can be extended to use real HTTP requests to payment gateways.

5. Extensibility

   * The codebase is modular, making it easy to plug in authentication, Celery for async SAP sync, or real-time notifications.
   * Built-in structure supports future unit testing, admin customization, and middleware enhancements.

Technology Stack:

* Backend: Python 3, Django, Django REST Framework
* Database: SQLite (default, can be switched to MySQL/PostgreSQL)
* External: Mock integration logic for SAP and Cashfree

Usage Scenarios:

* B2B applications onboarding channel partners, distributors, or vendors.
* Enterprise platforms where financial workflows (like payment verification and ERP sync) are critical.
* SaaS solutions offering onboarding + payment status dashboards.
